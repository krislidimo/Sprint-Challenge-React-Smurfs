1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
	
	Server-side routing only requests the data that is needed but has to refresh the page with each update.

 	Client-side routing requires the whole webside to load on first request which may cause high initial load times. Less data processing means routing between views is faster and smoother.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
	
	HyperText Transfer Protocol


3.  What does CRUD stand for?

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

 	Update - put
 	Delete - delete

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

	fetch APIs
